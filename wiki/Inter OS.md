### Inter OS

Inter OS is my long-long first PPTOS project...
The first creation of Inter OS was created in 2018 in PowerPoint 2003 with over 380+ slides and terrible UI. Unluckily, I lost the file and I didn't make anything until early 2020, when I had online classes, then I joined to the PPTOS Community. So, in 2020, I started working on the second version of Inter OS, but then, PowerPoint could not open the file, so I had to restart again, and after the 3rd try, I worked on the 4th Inter OS, but of course, in newer PowerPoint. I got some negative feedback on the UI, because that wasn't the best and with my unique desktop design... so I decided to not continue it, because useless, and then I did my biggest mistake ever... I- re-mo-ved the file :(
**Pro tip: Never delete your old files!**
So I started Nexton, which is my another cancelled PPTOS.
